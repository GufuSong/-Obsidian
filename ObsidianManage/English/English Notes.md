- Listen to some English every day ,  no matter what .  Make it a habits .
- Develop an English Mindset . Ask in English , answer in English .
- Use English to name the items you encounter in everyday life .
- Learn English through imagery and sensation ,  treat it as if it's your native language .  when you hear English ,  you don't translate it in your mind into Chinese ;  instead ,  it instantly evokes visuals and feelings directly in your consciousness .
